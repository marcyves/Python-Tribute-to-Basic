# Python Tribute to Basic

## Presentation
One purpose for this project is nostalgia, but the main one is to help anyone that wants to lean Python to find mini projects and code examples. It is a fun way to give hints to those who want to start developping with Python.

## Why
At the begining of personal computing, there was not much we could do with our computers. However, there was an essential central one: learning to code. And at that time the language was easy to choose, because there was only Basic on our computers. 

## How
There was several publications, books, journal that we could use to get ideas and example of code. One famous book was `Basic Computer Games`and fortunately, the source code from these examples can be found at http://vintage-basic.net/games.html 

The purpose of this project `Python Tribute to Basic`is to revice this spirit by porting old vintage Basic games to modern Python.

## Games available

  * [AceyDucey](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2) a very simple card game as a start.
  * [Awari](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=6) the ancient African game. That's true old memories for me, I coded that 40 years ago on my ORIC-1!
