# Python Tribute to Basic

## Presentation
The purpose is nostalgia and also to give hints to those who want to start developping with Python.

At the begining of personal computing, there was not much we could do with our computers. However, there was an essential central one: learning to code. And at that time the language was easy to choose, because there was only Basic on our computers. 

There was several publications, books, journal that we could use to get ideas and example of code.

The purpose of this project `Python Tribute to Basic`is to revice this spirit by porting old vintage Basic games to modern Python.
